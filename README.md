# handmd

## What is handmd?
handmd is library, which allows creating renderers of static websites.

Unlike projects like [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) it was created with 
rendering react applications in mind.

This project is somewhat similar to gatsby.js, but is written in go and allows more freedom when rendering pages.

## Early stages 
I am still developing this project. Even though it's not production ready yet I use it for my blog. Nevertheless, it's not probably mature enough yet for you to use, if you want super stable and mature framework, which will just work.
